* Create a database and rename `env.example` to `.env`, updating `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`
* In the `src` directory is the standard Laravel files. Run the following commands:

```shell
    composer install
    npm install
    php artisan migrate migrate:refresh --seed
    php artisan storage:link
    php artisan serve --port=8080
```

### Images 

It could be the symlink for images needs to be updated for you. 
If so run `rm -rf public/storage` from the src.

* Get container id by running `docker ps`
* Relink symlink for storage `docker exec -it 15f2f7114930 php artisan storage:link`
