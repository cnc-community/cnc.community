            <p>
                All donations regardless of size are greatly appreciated by the C&amp;C Community team.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a couple of options you can assign your donation towards:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To support site costs</strong> - This will be used towards keeping hosting and domain renewal costs down.</li>
                    <li><strong>To buy the team a beer</strong> - If you wish to thank the team for their work on the site, we'll split it between ourselves towards a üç∫!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>As a donator</strong> please confirm in the additional Paypal notes if you are happy to be listed as a Donator on our Website and Discord channel. 
                Please include the name and your Discord username so we can add you.
            </p>
